The ILS-S application was transformed from a program assembler language (PAL)-based software application running on a proprietary platform to a modernized Java-based software platform running on an open platform. A preliminary step on the path to success was the isolation of the SBSS COBOL software from all direct user interfaces and all external system communications. Once that isolation was accomplished, the COBol code was converted to Java and in place of the legacy legacy COB OL software. The Air Force's successful modernization of the ILS/S application immediately reduced the annual operating cost of the system by $21.3M - a savings that the Air Force was able to use to pay for the modernization effort.

A choice experiment is a survey approach designed to elicit consumer preferences based on hypothetical markets. Respondents are required to choose between multiple public or private goods. This choice is expected to occur by trading of the individual attributes of the different goods available, and choosing the good (or alternative) that provides the most utility. This approach to consumer behavior was first developed by Lancaster (1966), who states that the utility from a good is not derived from the good itself, but from its individual attributes. From a series of observed choices, a researcher then tries to infer the latent utility function. Traditionally, McFadden's random utility approach is used to describe the utility gained from a certain alternative on the basis of the attributes, utility weights for each attribute and a random error term to make the estimation of the utility weights feasible. However, in recent years, a number of other models have been developed which avoid some of the restrictive assumptions like the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption or the preference homogeneity

The author uses strategic interaction analysis, as developed by Lake and Powell (1999). Strategic interaction analysis distinguishes between two elements of strategic interaction: actors and their environments. On the actor side, actors are assumed to have preferences, defined simply as how they rank the possible outcomes defined by the environment. Actors' situational preferences consist of the ranking of preferred outcomes in more specific situations and depend upon the particular problem constellation and constellation of actors. The second attribute of an actor are its prior beliefs about the preferences of other actors. In particular, when actors are uncertain, these beliefs are crucial for the decision about which strategy to choose, and, in consequence, for the outcome of interaction.
The paper analyses IPE thought in Korea during its pre-modern and colonial eras, which it divides into three periods during which distinct IPE thoughts emerged. The first period is the eighteenth century, when Silhak, a new intellectual movement calling for the reform of traditional Korean society, arose. The second period is of the middle to late nineteenth century when Korea faced foreign threats and as a result eventually opened its doors to the world. The final period is that of colonial Korea (1910-1945) under imperial Japan, a time in which economic nationalist movements were pursued whilst Marxist theories were also introduced to the country.

The authors first employ a broad measure of CSR, using data from ASSET4, reflecting firm-level choices and activities in dealing with ESG issues. One major advantage of using this broad index is that it allows the authors to document a relationship between the included aspect and a measure of performance, however, the true driver of superior performance can be omitted due to omitted variable bias (OVB). Second, the authors use a different measure of ESG, which is based on a combination of three granular measures of three different ESG granities. The authors use this measure as a proxy for CSR and employ a two-stage least squares regression model to estimate the relationship between CSR dimensions and firm value.

- Statistical analyses of linkages between financial reports and stock market data have sought to guide financial reporting policy. The argument is vaguely appealing: stock markets are efficient in the sense of reflecting all relevant information in the prices; we can therefore use guidance from stock markets to identify which information (and which information-generating accounting methods) markets find relevant to determination of prices; this can be achieved by identifying the accounting methods which produce data with greater statistical proximity (e.g. higher correlation) with stock prices; and such methods of accounting can be used to promote market efficiency.

To achieve (1), the proposed approach uses pseudo-randomized processes to generate different instances. In the "divide" phase, the test region is divided into several nested and non-overlapping layers. Within each layer, a partial trail is generated with the desired spatial characteristics. Then, in the "combine", the partial trails are joined together to form a complete trail while preserving the desired characteristics.

The authors have manually and through automatic procedures gathered information of all the members of the boards of directors of the stock-listed companies in Spain in the timeframe between 2013 and 2017. The authors also explore useful information that companies must complete in their annual reports, they must justify the measures that they have undertaken to improve diversity in their boards. With a text treatment analysis, the authors could quantify the extent to which such responses are similar to the ones presented by the same company in the previous year (percentage of "self-plagiarism") or to the one presented by other companies in the same year (plagarism). The idea is to use quantitative measures obtained through the techniques of text treatment as a sign of interest that companies show a very high percentage of "plagagism" and "self" and precisely those companies with a higher percentage of gender diversity.

The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is applied to analyse outbound medical tourism from Nigeria to India. The interplay between the three major constructs in TPB is chosen to provide answers to the following research questions: Why do Nigerians go to India on medical tourism rather than stay back in Nigeria for their medical needs? What is the perception of (prospective) Nigerian MTs about the relative safety, quality and costs of medical services locally compared with what obtains in India? Can effective use of marketing communication tools by health-care facilities in Nigeria stem the tide of medical tourism by Nigerians to India?
First, within the sample analyzed, the efficiency of each hotel was calculated through the DEA method. The coefficient obtained was then used along with other exogenous variables and control variables in regression analyses against the hotel's foreign to total guest ratio. Potential selection bias due to the method of selecting the final sample from the original data available and the possibility of unobserved hotel foreign market participation was identified through the use of a Heckman selection model throughout the analysis. The results were analyzed by ANOVA based on the sample grouped according to DEA-assessed efficiency, which was also plotted as a non-parametric, Kernel Density distribution showing the distribution of the hotels according to their efficiency level.

This paper proposes a new cooperation dimension across alliances on empty container repositioning (ECR) for liners with headquarters in proximity. Fulfilling ad hoc empty container demand becomes possible and routine with strategic decision made timely among liners across alliances which pool-in certain amount of empty containers at agreed location on a pre-defined effective period. This critical period is measured by hours before any concerned vessel departs from the empty container surplus location where empty containers are available for repositioned. Higher repositioner efficiency is achieved without considering the possible cost and difficulty of the folding operations in different ports.

This issue is relevant because the world is continually moving toward an economy that is governed by knowledge and innovation and there is consensus in various areas that "the generation, exploitation and diffusion of knowledge are fundamental to economic growth, development and the well-being of nations."
The study was conducted in the city of Lima, Peru. The sample consisted of 1,000 mothers who have and live with their children who are in the preadolescent stage of development, meaning between 8 and 11 years. Mothers were selected for this research for two main reasons. First, mothers are more often the receptors of influence attempts than fathers and are considered to be better familiarized with the purchase influence attempt of their children. For methodological purposes, the last studied relationship regarding passive social power of children on influence from the mothers' perspective (Flurry and Burns, 2005) was used. To assess these variables, instruments already validated by their authors and which have been used in other studies were applied.

Different analyses were performed, both at a general level for the described period, and also at the quinquennial level. First, the analysis focused on studying a ranking of 40 leading journals that present a greater h-index in the discipline. In this ranking, it is possible to observe an interesting discussion that reveals that the most productive journals, i.e. those who have a greater quantity of published work, are not necessarily the most influential. The work also develops a graphical visualization of the publication and citation structure between journals by using VOS viewer software with bibliographic coupling and co-citation coupling. A quinquennial analysis, of five years, allowed us to recognize the transition among journals which focus on VC research.

The CRH2 train is studied as an example in this paper. The critical elements of the high-speed train system refer to the unit that plays an important role in maintaining the global topology and normal functions. The importance measure is the common method of system-critical elements identification, which can be roughly divided into the following two types. First, the reliability achievement worth (RAW) importance measures the importance of the component to maintain the current reliability level of the system, and alternately the reliability reduction worth (RRW) importance is mainly used to analyze the degree of influence of a failed component on the system reliability. Second, Birnbaum's importance is a sensitivity analysis method widely used in the field of component reliability to evaluate the influence of failed critical components on system reliability, and the Bayesian reliability importance is usually combined with fault tree analysis to measure the impact of failures on system failures.

The logic of China's 40-year economic reform is to clarify the stage of development, involving the theory of the primary stage of socialism and the Theory of the new era, which have generated four dimensions of reform. These four dimensions constitute the major theoretical breakthroughs in the field of political economy. Each of these major breakthroughs is accompanied by a series of innovations in relevant theories, which constitute a synthesis of a set of major theoretical innovations in political economics. In the process of reform, although every landmark theoretical breakthrough is marked by the speech of the highest leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) or the decision of the CPC National Congress, each breakthrough is attributable to the theoretical contribution made by the academia of politicaleconomics. Notably, these theoretical breakthroughS invariably embrace innovations in the discourse system of political economies.

- The paper is divided into seven major sections. The first part of introduction will provide background knowledge and general idea of how the analysis manages to address the problem of controversial results in a coherent and logical way. Next, five major theories of capital structure will be discussed to demonstrate the possible influence of leverage on the firm value. Around 15 empirical researches will be summarized, based on which hypotheses of this paper will be developed for future testing, including one on the relationship of interest and seven others concerning the moderating effect of potential third factors. The methodology is then explained with the basis of meta-analytical approaches as well as data collection and processing methods. After that, descriptive analysis will classify different groups of paper-specific features and exhibit descriptive statistics of the regression outcomes from the selected studies. In the fifth section of quantitative analysis, the strength of relationship between capital structure and firm performance, or the overall effect size, will be measured and combined according to the standardized framework proposed by Hedges and his colleagues

The first lesson to learn in proposing models in empirical research is that we need to be careful with their validity and that should be based upon theories. The actual accepted SFM came out from the fact that a naive model is not regular, so that, among other things, the standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method cannot be used. Afterward, when trying to make the statistical analysis more credible, by relaxing parametric assumptions, it seems useful to point out the sieves MLE method for, say, semi-nonparametric estimation in SFM.

The evolution of concepts defining disability has been conditioned mainly by socio-economic and legislative changes. This evolution is reflected in numerous models of disability (MD), for example, ethical, medical, social, biopsychosocial, geographical or economic models. Certain MDs illustrate how disability was perceived (in a given time, by a given social group) which influenced what action was undertaken and considered appropriate in terms of eliminating both the causes and effects of disability. Each MD was based on a different paradigm which also determined the action connected to accessibility to public spaces, buildings or tourism services for PwD.

This paper is based on the understanding that the root cause of social inequalities is actually the negative externality of poverty of consciousness. Two important examples are elaborated - first, dealing with the conscious responsibility of businesses and second, the conscious design of financial contracts. First, it is to be highlighted that businesses may either be reckless or responsible towards the society, ecology, and species, generating either positive or negative externalities. A pertinent example of negative externality is the rampant behavior of dumping waste into landfills, rivers, and seas, burning wastes and spewing toxins into the environment. On the other hand, businesses could be conscious of being impactful through positive externality. One effective example could be a zero-waste business strategy. It means that a compassionate institution such as waqf can make this as a purpose to maximize the positive externalities of businesses.

Based on the existing literature, this paper first details the construction of a low-carbon competitiveness evaluation index system involving the economy, society, the environment and policy to comprehensively measure the level of competitiveness. To overcome evaluation subjectivity, this study uses the catastrophe progression method proposed by Chinese scholar Du Xingfu; this can sequence the importance of all indices. The weight of each index is then determined using the principal component analysis method, and the low- carbon competitiveness of 31 provinces in China is calculated. Combined with the improved diagnosis of the obstacle indicator model, this allows the authors to deeply understand the obstacles to certain provinces' low- Carbon competitiveness development. Furthermore, the authors use the spatial autocorrelation model to analyze the distribution of low-Carbon competitiveness.

The warming effects of GH gases are not identical, but they can be converted into the CO2 equivalent by using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of each GH gas. GWP values are integrated over a 100-year timescale and therefore are not accurate measures of the instantaneous warming effects (IPCC, 2013a). CO2 emissions are reported as gigatons of carbon (GtC) or gigaton of carbon dioxide (GTCO2). The GtC values can be transformed into GtCO2 by multiplying by 3.664. Equivalent CO2 (CO2eq) is the concentration of CO2 that would cause the same level of radiative forcing (RF) as a given type and concentration of GH gas (i.e. methane (CH4), nitrogen oxide (N2O) and halogens). The aim of the COP21 is to keep a global temperature increase below 2degC by 2100 and to drive efforts to limit

The 3D printing of multilateral component of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with recycled ABS, PLA and HIPS thermoplastics was carried out on a 3D printer. The extruded material through the nozzle head is directed on the print bed and immediately hardened to ensure the part fabrication. To ensure the better dimensional stability of the component formed, it is required to process the printing below the melting point of the substrate. The 3D printers were used for 3DP of the multilateral components of ABS, TPU and PLA.
The authors first present a collection of numerical results on the response of pentamode metamaterials in the bending-dominated regime induced by the presence of rigid connections between the bars and the plates forming the structure, by studying the variation of such quantities with the lattice constant, the solid volume fraction, the cross-section area of the rods and the layer thickness. The authors then review available analytic formulae for the vertical and bending stiffness properties of layered pentamODE systems equipped with hinged connections. The examined applications are aimed to contribute to the diffusion of engineeredpentamode lattices into the broad field of structural engineering, which at present makes limited use of mechanical metammaterials.
Numerical and experimental investigation on the mechanical characterization of a special class of tensegrity metamaterials, named class th = 1 prisms is presented. First, the existence of freestanding placements in absence of external loads is studied by varying values of two aspect parameters: the relative twisting angle between the terminal bases and the inclination above the horizontal plan of the internal strings. Next, local solutions of the self-equilibrium problem are numerically derived through Newton-Raphson method and infinitesimal mechanisms of the analysed physical model are solved. The prestress stability of the structure is related to the positive definiteness of geometric stiffness matrix in correspondence to each possible mechanism. The following investigation of the elastic response of the examined structures in large displacements regime under a uniform uniaxial loading took place. The incremental equilibrium problem is numerically solved through a path-following approach.

In this paper, a 2-dimensional periodic material is considered as an example of a 2D lattice with a representative unit cell (RUC) and the Bloch wave vector is represented by a linear combination of the reciprocal space vectors b1 and b2. The spatial periodicity of the 2D periodic material has been studied by means of a numerical study.
This paper reviews an advanced numerical model capable to search a "safe" thrust surface of masonry vaults, via an iterative procedure based on a constrained lumped stress method (LSM) and a tensegrity approach capable to optimize the design of strengthening systems. The first model considers that such structures exhibit a no-tension membrane state of stress across the thrust surface. The membrane equilibrium is used to research an optimal shape of the surface of the masonry model, under specific no-Tension and position constraints. The Pucher's formulation is applied to identify the potential of the membrane stress, by a nonconforming variational approach, with defined polyhedral approximations. It leads to a representation of such a stress field by a discrete network of compressive forces and allows to predict the regions exposed to crack pattern and to evaluate a lower bound of the collapse load of the examined vault.

This paper proposes GrandBase, a knowledge base (KB) that generates actionable knowledge from Big Data. The proposed KB is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, which the authors refer to as {subject, predicate, object, object}. The authors propose GrandBase as a knowledge extraction and truth discovery platform for Big Data, which is capable of extracting machine-readable and interpretable information from large-scale, possibly conflicting, and different-structured data sources.
The authors use both DEA and AHP in hierarchy GRA. DEA is an objective data-oriented approach that allows each alternative (known as a decision-making unit in the DEA terminology) to choose its own favorable system of weights to optimize its relative performance. However, the subjective process of producing weights in AHP may not result in the best ranking position for each alternative in comparison to all the other alternatives. To overcome this issue, the authors integrate the two variants of DEA models in GRA, namely, additive DEA and analytic hierarchy process (AHP).
